    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",

    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "### Normalizing Numerical Features\n",
    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "**Answer: **\n",
    "\n",
    "----\n",
    "**1)Logistic Regression**\n",
    "\n",
    "*Real-world application:* \n",
    "\n",
    "Logistic Regression is a popular supervised learning algorithm which is deceptively named because it is actually a binary classification algorithm that outputs the probability that a new data point will have a positive label. Although it has a wide range of uses, the one that caught my attention was the following:\n",
    "Cancer detection - Classifying a tumour as being malignant or benign. \n",
    "This is a well-known use-case of logistic regression and has been used as an example for teaching the concept on many courses and articles, including this one which I primarily referred to, prior to answering this question:\n",
    "https://ayearofai.com/rohan-1-when-would-i-even-use-a-quadratic-equation-in-the-real-world-13f379edab3b\n",
    "\n",
    "I also found a full-blown research paper based on Cancer classification and prediction using logistic regression here: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1532046404000772#bib19\n",
    "TL;DR:\n",
    "\"In this paper, we propose a Bayesian approach to gene selection and classification using the logistic regression model. The basic idea of our approach is in conjunction with a logistic regression model to relate the gene expression with the class labels. We use Gibbs sampling and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods to discover important genes. To implement Gibbs Sampler and MCMC search, we derive a posterior distribution of selected genes given the observed data. After the important genes are identified, the same logistic regression model is then used for cancer classification and prediction\"\n",
    "\n",
    "*Strengths:*\n",
    "\n",
    " - It is simple to understand and simple to use\n",
    " - The outputs of Logistic regression are easy to interpret since they represent the probability P(y=1|X) \n",
    " - It does not make any assumptions about the normality of the data \n",
    "\n",
    "*Weaknesses:*\n",
    " - Sensitive to outliers.\n",
    " - Logistic regression tends to underperform when there are multiple or non-linear decision boundaries.\n",
    " - They are not flexible enough to naturally capture more complex relationships.[https://elitedatascience.com/machine-learning-algorithms]\n",
    "\n",
    "*Why is it a good candidate?*\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the fact that our problem has a dichotomous label and that logistic regression is reasonably fast and efficient, I'd say it makes for a good candidate for the problem at hand. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "----\n",
    "**2)DecisionTree**\n",
    "\n",
    "*Real-world application:* \n",
    "\n",
    "Decision tree classifiers are also quite popular, as far as supervised learning algorithms are concerned. It looks at the data and formulates questions to ask, the answers to which best split the data into positive and negative samples.\n",
    "A real-world application of Decision trees is in Weather Forecasting, as presented by this paper by Prof. Rajesh Kumar: https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/8d99/f88a8ccc95e33b5a87ee59cff19cd131f30e.pdf\n",
    "\n",
    "TL;DR:\n",
    "\"Since Decision-Tree evaluation can be quantified and it is simple to use, so a model using decision tree has been proposed by the author to predict the event like fog, rain and thunder by inputting average temperature, humidity and pressure. Which can be used by farmers or by peoples of all walks of life in taking the intelligent decisions\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "*Strengths:*\n",
    " - Simple to understand and use. \n",
    " - Can handle categorical data fairly well\n",
    " - Can Handle sparse data sets well \n",
    " - Robust towards outliers\n",
    "\n",
    "*Weaknesses:*\n",
    " - Highly prone to overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Why is it a good candidate?*\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we have applied One-hot encoding to our data, we now have a data set that's sparsely populated. So I think decision trees will give us good results here. \n",
    "\n",
    "----\n",
    "**3)AdaBoost**\n",
    "\n",
    "*Real-world application:* \n",
    "\n",
    "From my understanding of AdaBoosted algorithms, they work like this:\n",
    "First, you choose a \"weak predictor\" and make predictions of the data, or in our case, we use it to have an initial decision boundary. Then, we sequentially apply the same predictor to the data, each time increasing the weights of the previously misclassified data in hopes of classifying it correctly with the current predictor. This is done a certain number of times and we finally average the outcomes and hence build a \"strong predictor\". \n",
    "\n",
    "So AdaBoost, which is set to use DecisionTrees as the weak predictor by default, can be used in most applications that would have otherwise used any other algorithm supported by AdaBoost. One application of AdaBoost in the real world is in the Viola-Jones object detection framework which is referenced by this blog post-\n",
    "http://mccormickml.com/2013/12/13/adaboost-tutorial/ \n",
    "and elaborated on this Wikipedia page:\n",
    "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viola%E2%80%93Jones_object_detection_framework\n",
    " \n",
    "*Strengths:*\n",
    " - Adaboosted Algorithms help reduce bias in the base algorithms\n",
    " - They generally help achieve better scores than a stand-alone base estimator.\n",
    " - They perform very well in practice. \n",
    " - Required very little parameter tweaking\n",
    "\n",
    "*Weaknesses:*\n",
    " - The individual base estimators have to be tuned in order to avoid overfitting. \n",
    " - AdaBoost can be sensitive to noisy data and outliers\n",
    "\n",
    "*Why is it a good candidate?*\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we are using A DecisionTreeClassifier, I decided to also try out AdaBoost so that in addition to the advantages gained by the decision tree, we also get a sizeable bump in performance by using AdaBoost. \n",

    "As we can see from the visualizations provided in the previous section, The AdaBoost algorithm seems to out-perform the other two algorithms in terms of its predictive power.It achieved an f-score of about 0.725 and an accuracy score of 0.86 without any hyperparameter tuning and as we can see from the results, these scores are the highest among all three of the chosen algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now it must be noted that the DecisionTreeClassifier performs far better on the training set than the others but it is safe to assume that this is due to overfitting as we can see that it performs the worst among the three on the testing set.\n",

    "If our aim to have a highly precise model regardless of how long it takes to train it, the AdaBoost Algorithm might be best suited among the bunch but it is clear that it takes the longest time to train. So if time is a constraint, we might prefer using the Logistic Regression algorithm since as we can see, it's quite fast while still giving scores that are reasonably close to that of the AdaBoost Algorithm. \n",

    "\n",
    "So the final model chosen for CharityML, is called the AdaBoost Algorithm, where **AdaBoost** stands for **Ada**ptive **Boost**ing and here's how it works:\n",
    "At the heart of our AdaBoost is the DecisionTree Algorithm, whose job is to look at our data and come up with a certain number of questions to ask about it. For example: in our case, since the dataset consists of the columns `age` and `education`, a decision tree might come up with the questions:\n",
    "\n",
    " - Are younger people more likely to donate?\n",
    " - Is a person more likely to donate if he has a Bachelor's degree?\n",
    " - Will an older person without a formal degree earn less than $50k?\n",
    " \n",
    "etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "What the **AdaBoost** algorithm does is it creates a decision tree and shows it, the people in the dataset. As a result, the first decision tree will ask certain questions about its data points and will try it's best to predict the right answers but it will inevitably make mistakes. The next decision tree will be built to focus on these mistakes and try to get them right. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, after a certain number of trees have been created and a decent level of precision is achieved, we stop and form the final \"Strong\" model by averaging the decisions made by all the composite decision trees. When a person comes in, it asks all the questions suggested by its decision trees and tries to predict whether the person is likely to donate or not. i.e, if the person is likely to be earning more than $50K in a year. \n",

    "### Implementation: Model Tuning\n",

    "- Initialize the classifier you've chosen and store it in `clf`.\n",
    " - Set a `random_state` if one is available to the same state you set before.\n",
    "- Create a dictionary of parameters you wish to tune for the chosen model.\n",
    " - Example: `parameters = {'parameter' : [list of values]}`.\n",
    " - **Note:** Avoid tuning the `max_features` parameter of your learner if that parameter is available!\n",

    "The only difference being that `marital-status_Married-civ-spouse` was chosen instead of occupation. This is intriguing because although it makes sense that an unmarried person might be more likely to donate since he/she would have fever household expenses to worry about, I was expecting occupation to play a more prominent role. \n",

    "Another *difference* is `education-num` was chosen instead of `education`.\n",
    "This confused me at first because I didn't know what the former actually meant. But after a little bit of digging I found out that this was basically the numerical representation of the corresponding `education` and since it's continuous, it was chosen as an important feature. This makes sense because it will give a better Information gain than `education` which is one-hot encoded. "

    "### Feature Selection\n",
    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
